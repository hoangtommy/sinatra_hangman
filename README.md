# Hogwarts Hangman Project

In this project I begin to learn MVC with the lightweight framework Sinatra. I adapt one of my existing games, Hogwarts Hangman, for the web. Adding pictures to display the player's progress.

## Project Reflection
1. Implementing the concepts behind MVC was tough. Particularly wrapping my head around the various HTTP requests.
2. Another challenge was adapting the game from the command line to the web. Instead of displaying things to the terminal, I had to display it to the web. One ridiculous challenge was getting a white space to display correctly on the screen.
3. I'm pretty stoked that I briefly revisited HTML and CSS and was able to display the game in a more decorative style.
4. Areas for improvement definitely include refactoring the code to make the methods more streamline and clean. Although feedback at this point from others was that it's passable and I should move forward.
